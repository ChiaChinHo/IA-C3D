# IA-C3D
Inception-Attention 3D Convolutional Network

We combine 3D convolutional kernels, and attention mechanism to propose an approach for weakly-supervised learning action detection. The weakly-supervised learning action detection aims to prediction action locations with video-level labels only. In addition, the IA-C3D framework does not require to generate lots of action proposals in advance, and it therefore saves tremendous computational cost.
